# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Quilt?

Quilt is a modding toolchain developed primarily for Minecraft that has been
forked from The Fabric Project, primarily due to governing concerns.

## How does Quilt differ from Fabric?

The Quilt Project is governed by a set of autonomous teams overseeing different
parts of the project. These teams are given power to make decisions for their
component of the project. We hope that this will allow Quilt to incorporate
more PRs and other community suggestions and do so more fairly.


## Which parts of Fabric is Quilt forking?

All of them. Quilt is a hard fork of Fabric, and we aim to fork and maintain
all projects necessary to exist independently of it.


## Can Quilt load Fabric mods?

In most cases, yes. As Quilt is a fork, all Fabric mods should be compatible
with Quilt, and you can use them with it for the forseeable future.

## Can Fabric load Quilt mods?

Maybe. It depends on whether the mod in question uses features that are
exclusive to Quilt.

## What kind/amount of work can I expect to need to do to port my Fabric mod completely to Quilt?

Currently none! If your mod works with Fabric already, it works with Quilt.

Note that in the future, Quilt does plan to add some new APIs and other
changes, and these may require some work in order to take advantage of them,
but your mod should still work without them.


## How long will this backwards compatibility last?

Probably for quite a long time. We intend to maintain compatibility as long as
Fabric remains popular, or as long as we can. Rest assured, we will give notice
if the time comes for compatibility to be broken.


## Where can I find Quilt mods?

Wherever the mod developer distributes them. This is mostly on CurseForge or
Modrinth.


## Where can I get support for Quilt?

We provide user and developer support mostly on [Discord]({{ site.discord_invite }}).

## How do I start making Quilt mods?

You can find information about this [on our development page here](/dev/).


## How will the administration and moderation teams be managed?

You can find more about this on our [community page](/community/).


## How can I support Quilt?

However you like! [Join our community](/community/), use Quilt in your
modpacks, or [develop mods for Quilt](/dev/) or [contribute](/dev/).


## How do I install quilt?

See the [Install page](/install/).


## Who owns Quilt?

The community! Quilt doesn't really have the concept of an owner per-se. It is
controlled by a set of teams which are staffed by members of the community who
have taken an interest in contributing to the project. These teams vote on
various measures in order to decide what will happen with the part of the
project they oversee.
