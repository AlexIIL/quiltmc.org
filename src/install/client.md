Before getting started, you'll need to make sure you download a copy of the Quilt installer. 

The **Universal** download will work on any computer with Java properly installed -- but if you're on Windows, and 
you'd rather just use the Java installation that comes with Minecraft, then you can use the **Windows** download.

If you're not sure which to pick, just [install Java](https://java.com/en/download/) and use the **Universal** download.

Once you have a copy of the Quilt installer downloaded, follow these steps:

1. If you haven't already, download a copy of the Minecraft launcher 
   [from the Minecraft website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download), and install it
2. If you have the Minecraft launcher open, close it before continuing
3. Find the Quilt installer you downloaded and run it
4. Ensure that you have the **Client** tab selected
5. Select the version of Minecraft you wish to install Quilt for
6. Select the version of the Quilt loader you'd like to use
7. Click the **Install** button

Assuming you left the **Generate profile** box checked, you'll notice that a new Quilt installation will have been 
created for you. Otherwise, you can click on the **Installations** tab at the top and create a new one, picking the new 
Quilt entry from the **Version** dropdown.

That's all there is to it - install some mods, launch your new installation, and have fun playing!
