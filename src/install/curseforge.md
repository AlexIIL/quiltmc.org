### Status: Partially Implemented

CurseForge does not currently support Quilt in their launcher, but they've stated they're planning on it. They do,
however, support Quilt on the CurseForge website.

Thanks to Claycorp, RedBlue and Yamza for their help, as well as to everyone that supported our
[CurseForge Ideas suggestion](https://curseforge-ideas.overwolf.com/ideas/CF-I-2662). We couldn't have gotten this far 
without you!

# Manual Installation

It is not currently possible to manually install Quilt into a CurseForge instance. Please show your support on the
suggestion linked above if you'd like to see CurseForge adding Quilt to their services!
