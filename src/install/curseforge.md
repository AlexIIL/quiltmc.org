### Status: Pending Submission

CurseForge does not currently support Quilt. We've been in contact with them about adding Quilt support, but they don't
feel that adding support while Quilt is still in beta is the right decision. For that reason, we're holding off on
approaching them for now.

# Manual Installation

At the moment, we don't know whether it's possible to manually install Quilt using the CurseForge Launcher. If you 
have any information on this, please let us know!
