### Status: Work In Progress

MultiMC does not currently support Quilt, but a member of the community has 
[submitted a pull request](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/pull/3760) that adds Quilt support. If you're 
interested in seeing Quilt support in MultiMC, feel free to take a look at that PR.

# Manual Installation

While it is technically possible to add Quilt to any MultiMC instance manually, it's a somewhat technical process that
involves writing your own JSON component definition. For that reason, we're not publishing instructions on how to do 
that here &mdash; however, we are working on automatically generating MultiMC instances you can import to easily get 
set up with Quilt.

# Installing Mods

To install mods to your MultiMC instance, simply follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the instance you'd like to install mods to and select **Edit Instance**, or click on it once and
   select **Edit Instance** from the menu on the right of the window
2. Select **Mods** from the list on the left, and drag-and-drop the mod files you've downloaded into the mod list
3. Ensure you have the **Quilt Standard Libraries** installed, which you can find
   [on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)

Start up your game, and the mods should be available immediately. If you run into any issues, please take a look at the
[troubleshooting page](/usage/troubleshooting), or [join us on Discord](https://discord.quiltmc.org) to ask for support!
