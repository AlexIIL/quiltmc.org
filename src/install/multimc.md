### Status: Work In Progress

MultiMC does not currently support Quilt, but a member of the community has 
[submitted a pull request](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/pull/3760) that adds Quilt support. If you're 
interested in seeing Quilt support in MultiMC, feel free to take a look at that PR.

# Manual Installation

While it is technically possible to add Quilt to any MultiMC instance manually, it's a somewhat technical process that
involves writing your own JSON component definition. For that reason, we're not publishing instructions on how to do 
that here &mdash; however, we are working on automatically generating MultiMC instances you can import to easily get 
set up with Quilt.
