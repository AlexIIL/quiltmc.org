First, download the Quilt Installer. Don't worry about the Minecraft version yet.

<div class="button-grid">
<a href="#" class="button primary">Universal (.jar)</a>
<a href="#" class="button">Windows (.exe, 64-bit)</a>
</div>

Before you run the installer, make sure to close the Minecraft Launcher if you have it opened.

Then, run the installer and select the version of Minecraft you wish to install Quilt for. If you are installing for a
snapshot version, you may have to select the "Show snapshots" box.

Click "Install", and Quilt Loader will be installed.

If you left the "Create profile" box checked, when you open your Minecraft Launcher, there should be a new installation
for Quilt. Note that you may need to go to the "Installations" tab in your Minecraft Launcher and on the top right
select "Modded" versions in order to be able to see it.

## Which should I use?

### Universal (.jar)

The Universal (.jar) download will work on any operating system, however you must have Java installed in order to use
it.

### Windows (.exe)

The Windows (.exe) download will try to detect and use the Java installation that Minecraft: Java Edition uses. However,
it's only designed for use on 64-bit versions of Windows - if you're using a 32-bit version of Windows, use the 
Universal (.jar) option instead.

Please note that you may be shown a SmartScreen warning message about an "Unknown publisher". Unfortunately, we cannot
currently do anything about this. If it makes you feel uncomfortable, use the Universal (.jar) option, or try another
launcher.
