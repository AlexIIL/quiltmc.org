### Status: Work In Progress

PolyMC does not currently support Quilt, but its developers 
[are working on a pull request](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/pull/185) that adds Quilt support. If you're
interested in seeing Quilt support in GDLauncher, feel free to take a look at that PR.

# Manual Installation

While it is technically possible to add Quilt to any PolyMC instance manually, it's a somewhat technical process that
involves adding a JSON file to your instance manually. For that reason, we're not publishing instructions on how to do
that here &mdash; however, we are working on automatically generating MultiMC instances (which PolyMC supports) you can 
import to easily get set up with Quilt.
