# Quilt Community Guidelines

## Overview

This document describes what the Quilt Community is, general guidelines for the community, how rules will be changed and outlines some forms of unacceptable behaviour.

This document should be refered to first in most instances and any confusion arising from it should be directed towards the staff team.

## The Quilt Community

The community guidelines defines "The Quilt community" as all communication within the Quilt ecosystem. This includes every forum of communication that is officially part of the Quilt project.

For clarity, these community guidelines apply to all of the following:

- Quilt Discord server
- Quilt GitHub organization
	- This includes: issues, pull requests and any discussion inside issues or pull requests.
- User comments on the Quilt Twitch channel

<!--Insert additional platforms as nessecary--> 

## Guidelines

Quilt has a fairly short and sweet set of rules. These boil down to:

1. Don't be a jerk
2. Listen to project staff

Creating an exhaustive list for all negative behavior we want to avoid is impossible and likely won't help. The kinds of people who would engage in such a way in the first place probably aren't the people we want around at all.

However, there are specific behaviors we want to avoid in our community. The following example of behaviors are not permitted in the Quilt community:

1. Using language or posting content that can reasonably be considered discriminatory.
	a. Most of the language banned here should be obvious, but will be listed in more detail below in Zero Tolerance Items.

2. Posting pornographic, distasteful, or excessively violent content.
	a. This is similar to the first rule.

3. Spamming or excessively sending messages, including repeating questions, resending links too frequently, or posting the same question to multiple channels.
	a. Spam bots and trolling users will be immediately banned without warning.
	b. Users who are looking for help and are incessantly repeating questions because they aren't receiving any answers should be asked to stop repeating their question so often and be patient instead.
		i. Repeating a question after some time has passed and the question is no longer current and the conversation has changed is fine, as long as it's not too repetitive.
		ii. Repeating a question because the user is receiving help but doesn't like the answer they received is not fine.

4. Non-hateful and non-bigoted cursing is fine for the most part
    a. However this is no acceptable in user names
    b. If someone is cursing in every message, they should be asked to calm down and stop using those words so much.

5. Formatting usernames to be difficult to read, to impersonate others, to advertise, or to be inappropriate.
	a.  If a curse word is in their username, that's basically the same as saying that word every time they send a message - so must be removed.
	b. Impersonating people includes anyone in or out of the server, not just staff and not just those in Quilt.
	c. Usernames that are nothing but a bunch of symbols that are impossible to pronounce aren't very conducive of a good conversation environment. However, this does not apply to usernames in different languages and alphabets. There is a difference between having a username in Japanese and having only random symbols as your username.

6. Pinging server staff, moderators, or contributors without a valid reason.
	a. Valid reasons include when normal users may not be able to help, or when reporting dupe glitches or critical bugs. However you should responsibly disclose the critical bugs and dupe glitches first.
	b. Someone pinging a particular person because they are responding to that person is not a problem and not even warranting of a warning.
	c. There are some users who don't want to be pinged, so please respect their decision.

## Zero Tolerance Items

Particularly severe issues represent a behavior and a kind of person we don't want associated with Quilt in any way. These behaviors will result in an immediate ban without warning:

- Racial slurs or racist speech
- Sexist slurs or sexist speech
- Homophobic or transphobic slurs or speech
- Ableist slurs or speech â€” there's confusion around this term, so to help clarify:
    - Ableist slurs are words that refer to people with disabilities used as insults
    - Ableist speech is hate speech directed towards people with disabilities
- Any other hate speech not already listed
- Doxxing people
- Personal attacks
- Use of Quilt for the purpose of cheats
	- A cheat is a modification to the game that intentionally grants the user an unfair advantage over another user who may or may not have the modification installed.
	- Moderators have the final say over what classifies as a cheat.
- Use of Quilt for the creation and or spread of malware.

This list is not exhaustive. If someone is engaging in bad behavior not conducive to a friendly environment and moderators believe it warrants an immediate ban, then they will do so.

When someone is removed for violating one of these items, all messages in question will be removed and reported to discord if necessary.

## Ban appeals

TODO: Detail ban appeals, probably needs platform specific means?

## Interpretation

Moderators have final say in interpreting the community guidelines.

## Amendments

Changes to the community guidelines must be announced via a blog post through the website and given a  week approval period with allowance for comments before changes are made.
