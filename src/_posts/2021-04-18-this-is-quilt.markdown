# This is Quilt

This is the Quilt Project: A Mod Loader and set of APIs designed to *target mostly* [Minecraft](www.minecraft.net) -- the popular sandbox block building game.

Quilt can be considered a hard fork from the [Fabric Project](www.fabric.net) and is designed to take what worked well and expand on it further.

## Why a "Hard Fork"?

Fabric has been an amazing project for the Minecraft modding scene, however progress in some areas have stagnated.

The Quilt Team wishes to make new technological decisions that are currently not on the road map for Fabric. Such changes are:
- <PlaceHolder>
- <PlaceHolder>
- <PlaceHolder>

More information on the technical changes will be expanded on in future blog posts and Requests for Comments (RFCs).

The Quilt Project also wishes to make changes in areas touching how social spaces are moderated and the interaction with the development team:
- <PlaceHolder>
- <PlaceHolder>
- <PlaceHolder>

### Will this not create instability?

It would be improper to say there will **not** be any flux with this project; The Quilt Team is taking its time to establish proper processes, a solid team and a well defined set of expectations for all to follow.

## Important Documents and RFCs

Quilt uses a proccess of RFCs (Request for Comment) to drive major technical design and community space changes. The RFCs are designed to make clear what changes are on the horizon, allow for comment from the community and as a recorded location for how specific parts of The Quilt Project work (eg Governance). 

Below are what can be considered foundational Quilt Project documents (this does not confer less value on other RFCs, just that the ones listed inform the format and contents of others):

**THIS NEEDS TO BE UPDATED AS THE POST ARE MERGED**
- [The RFC Proccess](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/pull/1)
- [Quilt Governance Document](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/pull/6)
- [Community Guidelines](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/pull/5)
- [Community Team](https://github.com/QuiltMC/rfcs/pull/7)

## Who is involved?

To view an approximate membership, our [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/QuiltMC) is a good starting place. This list is not exhaustive as it may not include members who are part of the community team.

## Can I mod on Fabric and Quilt?

*Partially*; Fabric mods will be able to run on Quilt. There **will be a point** in the future where this might not be possible. Most information on this will be published at a future date and via the RFC proccess.
