# Install Quilt for Minecraft Launcher

<img class="logo right fshadow" alt="Minecraft Logo" src="/assets/img/launchers/minecraft.png" />

The Minecraft version can be selected in the installer, this download works for
every version we support.

<a href="{{ page.jarurl }}" class="button primary">Download installer (Universal/.jar)</a>
<a href="{{ pakge.exeurl }}" class="button">Download installer (Windows/.exe)</a>

(Please note that the Windows .EXE may show a SmartScreen warning message about
an "Unknown publisher". Unfortunately, we cannot currently do anything about
this. If it makes you feel uncomfortable, use the .JAR or MultiMC method to
install.)

Make sure to follow the installation instructions!

**Most mods will also require you to install [Fabric (API)]() into the mods folder.**
